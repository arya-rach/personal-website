            J.k. Rowling
        </h1>
        <p>
            J.K. Rowling first had the idea for Harry Potter while delayed on a train travelling from Manchester to London King's Cross in 1990.
            Over the next five years, she began to plan out the seven books of the series.
            She wrote mostly in longhand and amassed a mountain of notes,
            many of which were on scraps of paper.

            Arundhati Roy
        </h1>
        <p>
            Arundhati Roy studied architecture at the School of Planning and Architecture,
            but it was literature that was her true calling.
            Her screenplay, which was based on her own life account of an architecture student,
            titled In Which Annie Gives It Those Ones won rave acclaim and she also performed in Electric Moon.
